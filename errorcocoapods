    [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "firebase_core":
      In Podfile:
        firebase_core (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_core/ios`)

    Specs satisfying the `firebase_core (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_core/ios`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
